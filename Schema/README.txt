## Overview
	This repository contains SQL files and a SQL model that need to be set up and executed on a MySQL server.
	The SQL scripts contain database schema, data manipulation queries, and potentially stored procedures, functions, or triggers.

## Prerequisites
	Before proceeding with the setup, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

	1. MySQL Server: The MySQL server must be installed and running on the target machine.
	2. MySQL Workbench (Optional): While not mandatory, MySQL Workbench can be helpful for managing the
		 MySQL server and executing SQL scripts.

## Setup Instructions
	Follow these steps to set up and execute the SQL files:
	Connect to the MySQL server either through MySQL Workbench or a command-line interface.

	Execute SQL Scripts:

	1. Open MySQL Workbench or use a MySQL command-line interface.
	2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
	3. Execute each SQL script in the following order:
		- If there's a script for creating the database schema, execute it first.
		- Then execute scripts for data manipulation, stored procedures, functions, triggers, etc., as needed.

	Verify Execution: After executing all the SQL scripts, verify that the database schema 
	has been created successfully and any data manipulation operations have been performed 	correctly.

## Additional Notes
	Dependencies: Ensure that any dependencies required by the SQL scripts, such as specific MySQL versions or privileges, are met.
	Configuration: If the SQL scripts rely on specific configurations (e.g., database credentials), ensure they 
	are correctly configured before execution.
	Error Handling: If you encounter any errors during execution, troubleshoot them based on the error
	messages provided by MySQL. Common issues include syntax errors, missing privileges, or conflicts with existing database objects.
	Contact: If you encounter any difficulties or have questions about the SQL scripts, feel free to contact the author for assistance.
